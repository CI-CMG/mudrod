The instruments on OSTM make direct observations of the following quantities: altimeter range, significant wave height, ocean radar backscatter cross-section (a measure of wind speed), ionospheric electron content (derived by a simple formula), tropospheric water content, mean sea surface, Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA), and position relative to the GPS satellite constellation.  These data contain less parameters than the regular GDR data.
