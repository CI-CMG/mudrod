Earth-orbiting satellite specifically designed and tasked for the remote sensing of Earth's oceans. Through NASA sponsorship, JPL managed and operated Seasat, which was launched on June 28, 1978. Seasat carried a payload of five scientific instruments, including the first satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Other instruments included a radar altimeter (ALT), Seasat-A satellite scatterometer (SASS), scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR), and the visible/infrared radiometer (VIRR). This array of scientific instruments enabled measurements of sea surface wind velocity, land and sea surface topography, ocean surface salinity, ocean surface gravity waves, land and sea ice, and sea surface temperature. Seasat was in continuous operation for 106 days and served as the precursor to many of NASA's later missions."],"DatasetSource-Source-OrbitPeriod":["100.7"],"DatasetSource-Source-InclAngle":["108"],"DatasetSource-Source-Type":["SPACECRAFT"],"DatasetSource-Source-ShortName":["SEASAT-A"],"DatasetSource-Source-ShortName-Full":["SEASAT-A"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-LongName":["Seasat-A Scatterometer System"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-LongName-Full":["Seasat-A Scatterometer System"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-Description":["The Seasat-A Satellite Scatterometer (SASS) contains four dual-polarized (both vertical and horizontal) fan-beam radar antennas, which were designed to produce an X-shaped scanning pattern across Earth's surface.

SASS provided 95% global coverage every 36 hours at a sampling footprint of approximately 50 km within a 1900 km-wide swath. SASS was designed to measure radar backscatter sensitive to wind speeds from 4-26 m s-1 referenced to 10 meters above the ocean surface. SASS was intended to be accurate to within 2 m s-1 or 10% (whichever is greater) of the observed wind speed and within 20Â¿ of the observed wind direction."],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName":["SASS"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName-Full":["SASS"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-SwathWidth":["1900"],"_version_":1537168172278349824,"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-MaxLength":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-ObligationFlag":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Scope":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-LongName":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Type":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Scope":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-Value":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-ShortName":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Description":["NULL"]}
