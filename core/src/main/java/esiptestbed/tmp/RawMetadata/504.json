The GMSL is a 1-dimensional time series of globally averaged Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA) from TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 and OSTM/Jason-2.  It starts in September 1992 to present, with a lag of up to 4 months.  All biases and cross-calibrations have been applied to the data so SSHA are consistent between satellites.  Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) has not been applied, but it has been smoothed with a 60 day filter.  These data are available in ASCII format.","Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"Integrated Multi-Mission Ocean Altimeter Data for Climate Research","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-Reference":"Beckley, B.D., N.P.
