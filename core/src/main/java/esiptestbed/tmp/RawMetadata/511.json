This radiometer has the capability to provide detailed maps of thermal radiation from the sea surface, and clouds.  The AVHRR operates in two modes: 1) High Resolution Picture Image or HRPT mode, which are high density images with 1km resolution, and are transmitted directly to local ground stations and 2) Global Area Coverage, or GAC mode, which are the same observations as are transmitted during the HRPT mode, but averaged together to obtain a value representative of an area 4km in diameter. GAC data are digitized and recorded on the satellite to provide global coverage.","The Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI)  has the capacity to observe the Earth in 12 spectral channels. Eight of these channels are in the thermal infrared, providing among other information, observations of the temperatures of clouds, land and sea surfaces at approximately 5 km resolution with a 15 minute duty cycle.","The AVHRR is a radiation-detection imager that can be used for remotely determining cloud cover and the surface temperature. Note that the term surface can mean the surface of the Earth, the upper surfaces of clouds, or the surface of a body of water.","The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument provides high radiometric sensitivity (12 bit) in 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelength from 0.4 m to 14.4 m.
