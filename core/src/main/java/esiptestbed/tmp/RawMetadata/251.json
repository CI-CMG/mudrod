The MGDR-B combines measurements from two altimeters, TOPEX, a NASA dual frequency (Ku and C band) instrument, and a French (CNES) instrument which is a proof-of-concept solid-state altimeter, Poseidon (Ku band).  The parameters are slightly different than the regular pass data in the MGDR-B, but does contain significant wave height, sigma-0, wet troposphere, ionospheric correction, tides and the parameters required to calculate Sea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA).

The 21 GHz channel is the primary channel for water-vapor measurement. It is redundant (21A and 21B). The 18 GHz and 37 GHz channels are used to remove the effects of wind speed and cloud cover, respectively in the water-vapor measurement.
