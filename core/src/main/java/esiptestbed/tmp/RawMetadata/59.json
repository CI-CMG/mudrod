This data set (MGDR-B) contains generation B data which replaces the generation A data set. The objective of the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission, launched in August 1992 and currently operating, is to determine ocean topography with a sea surface height measurement precision of 3 cm and a sea level measurement accuracy of 13 cm. The data product combines measurements from two altimeters, a NASA dual frequency (Ku and C band) instrument similar to the Geosat altimeter, and a French (CNES) instrument which is a proof-of-concept solid-state altimeter (Ku band). This data set contains mean sea surface, ionospheric corrections, sigma0 and all parameters needed to calculate sea surface height anomalies and total electron content.  The data are in binary format.","Dataset-SatelliteSpatialResolution":8.0,"Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"TOPEX/POSEIDON ALTIMETER MERGED GEOPHYSICAL DATA RECORD GENERATION

The 21 GHz channel is the primary channel for water-vapor measurement. It is redundant (21A and 21B). The 18 GHz and 37 GHz channels are used to remove the effects of wind speed and cloud cover, respectively in the water-vapor measurement. TMR data are sent to CNES for processing along with their altimeter data.
