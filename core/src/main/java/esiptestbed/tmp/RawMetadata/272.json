The data are provided for experienced users who wish to assess the quality of the product.\r\nThe coefficients of degree 1 and 2 have clear physical interpretations. The degree 1 coefficients represent the relative position of the geocenter (the center of mass of the Earth) relative to the center of figure (defined, in practice, by the position of laser tracking stations on the surface of the Earth). The degree 2 order zero coefficient is described at http://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/get-data/gravity-harmonics/. The degree 2 order 1 coefficients are related to the relative position of the principal figure axis of the Earth relative to the rotational axis. In the absence of external torques, those two axes would be very close [Wahr, 1987 and 1990]. However, as a consequence of excitations due to tidal and other mass redistribution within the Earth system (dominated by seasonal variations), the two axes are not completely aligned, and the rotational axis precesses around the Earths principal figure axis (causing the approximate 435 day Chandler wobble).","Dataset-SatelliteSpatialResolution":4000.0,"Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"CSR Weekly 5x5 Gravity Harmonics","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-AcrossTrackResolution-Double":4000.0,"Dataset-Reference":"Cheng, M., J.
