This BLUELink Regional Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (RAMSSA) v1.0 system blends satellite SST observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR), and, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE), and in situ data from ships, and drifting and moored buoy from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS). The processing results in daily foundation SST estimates that are largely free of nocturnal cooling and diurnal warming effects.","Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"ABOM-L4HRfnd-AUS-RAMSSA_9km","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-Reference":"","Dataset-OriginalProvider":"Australian Bureau of Meteorology","Dataset-ProjectionType":"Cylindrical Lat-Lot","Dataset-LongitudeResolution":"0.083","Dataset-SwathWidth":"","Dataset-Doi":"10.5067/GHRAM-4FA01","Dataset-ImageUrl":"http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/Podaac/thumbnails/ABOM-L4HRfnd-AUS-RAMSSA_09km.jpg","Dataset-TemporalResolution-Group":"Daily","Dataset-PersistentId":"PODAAC-GHRAM-4FA01","Dataset-TemporalRepeatMin":"","Dataset-ProcessingLevel":"4","Dataset-ProcessingLevel-Full":"4","Dataset-HorizontalResolutionRange":"none","Dataset-AlongTrackResolution":"","Dataset-LatitudeResolution":"0.083","Dataset-Id":"1","Dataset-TemporalResolutionRange":"none","Dataset-UserPopularity":72,"Dataset-TemporalResolution":"1 Day","Dataset-TemporalResolution-Full":"1 Day","Dataset-AllTimePopularity":284,"Dataset-TemporalRepeatMax":"","DatasetRegion-RegionDetail":["Region around Australia"],"DatasetRegion-Region":["Oceania"],"DatasetRegion-Region-Full":["Oceania"],"Dataset-Provider-LongName":"Australian Bureau of Meteorology","Dataset-Provider-Type":"DATA-PROVIDER","Dataset-Provider-ShortName":"ABOM","Dataset-Provider-ProviderResource-Path":["http://www.bom.gov.au"],"Dataset-DatasetCoverage-StopTimeLong":"","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-StartTimeLong":"1207008000000","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-TimeSpan":2997,"DatasetCitation-Publisher":["Australian Bureau of Meteorology"],"DatasetCitation-SeriesName":["RAMSSA L4 9 km"],"DatasetCitation-OnlineResource":["http://www.bom.gov.au/bmrc/ocean/BLUElink/SST/BLUElink_L4_file_format_v4.pdf"],"DatasetCitation-Creator":["Australian Bureau of Meteorology"],"DatasetCitation-Version":["1.0"],"DatasetCitation-Title":["BLUElink Regional Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (RAMSSA), daily, 9 km resolution"],"DatasetCitation-ReleaseDateLong":["1201132800000"],"DatasetCitation-ReleasePlace":["Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne, Australia"],"DatasetCitation-CitationDetail":["Product created by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Role":["Technical Contact","Investigator"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Phone":["+61-3-96694746","+61-3-96694394"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Address":["Australian Bureau of Meteorology, GPO Box 1289, Melbourne, Vic, 3001 AUSTRALIA","Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, GPO Box 1289, Melbourne, Vic, 3001 AUSTRALIA"],"DatasetContact-Contact-NotifyType":["none","none"],"DatasetContact-Contact-MiddleName":["none","none"],"DatasetContact-Contact-LastName":["Majewski","Beggs"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Email":["ghrsst@bom.gov.au","h.beggs@bom.gov.au"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Fax":["+61-3-96694168","+61-3-96694660"],"DatasetContact-Contact-FirstName":["Leon","Helen"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Provider-LongName":["Australian Bureau of Meteorology","Australian Bureau of Meteorology"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Provider-Type":["DATA-PROVIDER","DATA-PROVIDER"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Provider-ShortName":["ABOM","ABOM"],"CollectionDataset-GranuleRange360":"N","DatasetCoverage-StartTimeLong-Long":1207008000000,"DatasetCoverage-MaxDepth":"","DatasetCoverage-StopTimeLong":"","DatasetCoverage-NorthLat":"20","DatasetCoverage-MaxAltitude":"","DatasetCoverage-StopTimeLong-Long":9223372036854775807,"DatasetCoverage-SouthLat":"-70","DatasetCoverage-StartTimeLong":"1207008000000","DatasetCoverage-WestLon":"60","DatasetCoverage-MinDepth":"","DatasetCoverage-MinAltitude":"","DatasetCoverage-EastLon":"-170","DatasetLocationPolicy-BasePath":["ftp://ftp.nodc.noaa.gov/pub/data.nodc/ghrsst/L4/AUS/ABOM/RAMSSA_09km","http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/nph-dods/ghrsst/L4/AUS/ABOM/RAMSSA_09km","ftp://podaac-ftp.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/ghrsst/data/L4/AUS/ABOM/RAMSSA_09km","file:///store/ghrsst/open/data/L4/AUS/ABOM/RAMSSA_09km","http://podaac-opendap.jpl.nasa.gov/opendap/allData/ghrsst/data/L4/AUS/ABOM/RAMSSA_09km/"],"DatasetLocationPolicy-Type":["REMOTE-FTP","REMOTE-OPENDAP","LOCAL-FTP","ARCHIVE-OPEN","LOCAL-OPENDAP"],"DatasetMetaHistory-VersionId":"1","DatasetMetaHistory-RevisionHistory":"2008-01-29 L.
