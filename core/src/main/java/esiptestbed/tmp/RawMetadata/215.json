The coverage is from August 1999 through October 2009. The QuikSCAT Project produced this dataset in support of the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) under the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and was first made available via the Earth System Grid. This dataset was derived directly from the QuikSCAT Level 2B dataset, which can be accessed here: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/QSCAT_LEVEL_2B. The SeaWinds instrument is a conical scanning pencil-beam radar, with dual-beam and dual-polarization capability, operating at Ku-band to provide all-weather ocean surface wind vector retrievals. Along with this dataset, two additional ancillary data files are included in the same directory which contain the number of observations and standard error co-located on the same 1 degree grids. This wind vector dataset is designed to be used in conjunction with the complete wind vector dataset, which include separate dataset files for both the Northward component and total wind speed of the wind vector. All corresponding dataset and ancillary data files are included in a common directory.

The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage. The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.  The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans."],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName":["SEAWINDS"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName-Full":["SEAWINDS"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-SwathWidth":["1800"],"DatasetVersion-VersionId":["1"],"DatasetVersion-VersionDateLong":["1334189067965"],"DatasetVersion-Description":["Creation of Dataset via Metadata Tool."],"DatasetVersion-Version":["1"],"Collection-LongName":["Gridded Climate Variables for Model Intercomparison","Climate Data Record"],"Collection-LongName-Full":["Gridded Climate Variables for Model Intercomparison","Climate Data Record"],"Collection-CollectionId":["669","1184"],"Collection-ShortName":["Gridded Climate Variables for Model Intercomparison","CDR"],"Collection-ShortName-Full":["Gridded Climate Variables for Model Intercomparison","CDR"],"_version_":1537168207092121600,"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-MaxLength":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-ObligationFlag":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Scope":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-LongName":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Type":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Scope":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-Value":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-ShortName":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Description":["NULL"]}
