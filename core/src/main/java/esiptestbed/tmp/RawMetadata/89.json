The analysis is based upon nighttime GHRSST L2P skin and subskin SST observations from several satellites.  The sensors include the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua.
