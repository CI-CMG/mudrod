These estimates are obtained from the analysis of Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) data to five geodetic satellites: LAGEOS-1 and 2, Starlette, Stella and Ajisai. The background gravity model used in the SLR analysis is consistent with GRACE Release-04 or Release-05 processing, including the use of the same Atmosphere-Ocean De-aliasing (AOD) dataset as the corresponding GRACE release. However, the monthly mean of the AOD model (included in the file) has been restored, so that the coefficients represent the full month's signal. For the same reason, no rate models have been applied. These data are housed at the Center for Space Research at University of Texas Austin.
