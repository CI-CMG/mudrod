This dataset also includes parameters to estimate the impact of rain upon wind speed and direction.  Wind vectors are accurate to within 2 m/s (vector speed) and 20 degrees (vector direction). Rain flags are provided for each wind vector cell to assist in identifying potential rain contamination. An ASCII inline quality report (Q2B) has been generated for each L2B file; each Q2B file provides statistics of various quality elements pertaining to the processing of a specific L2B file. This product utilizes JPL's most up-to-date calibration, validation, and science data processing from the QSCAT-1/F13 geophysical model function, adopted in July of 2006.","Dataset-SatelliteSpatialResolution":25.0,"Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"SEAWINDS_LEVEL_2B_AMSR","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-AcrossTrackResolution-Double":25.0,"Dataset-Reference":"Lungu, T., July 2006.

The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage. The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.  The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans.","The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) is an eight-frequency, total-power passive microwave radiometer with dual polarization (except two vertical channels in the 50GHz band)."],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName":["SEAWINDS","AMSR"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName-Full":["SEAWINDS","AMSR"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-SwathWidth":["1800","1600"],"_version_":1537168252033040384,"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-MaxLength":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-ObligationFlag":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Scope":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-LongName":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Type":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Scope":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-Value":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-ShortName":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Description":["NULL"]}
