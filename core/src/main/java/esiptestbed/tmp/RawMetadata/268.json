This annually updated data product extends from October 14, 1992 through November 4, 2009.  SSHA and current velocities are derived from the AVISO quarter degree DT UPD MSLA version 3.0 grids, 0.75 deg and greater away from the coast.  Values within 0.75 deg of the coast are derived from tide gauge observations and interpolated out to the altimeter filled region.  Details on how these data are derived can be found in: Saraceno, M., P. T. Strub, and P. M.
