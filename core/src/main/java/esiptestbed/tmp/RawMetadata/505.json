This product uses optimal interpolation (OI) by interpolating and extrapolating SST observations from different sources, resulting in a smoothed complete field. The sources of data are satellite (AVHRR) and in situ platforms (i.e., ships and buoys), and the specific datasets employed may change over. At the marginal ice zone, sea ice concentrations are used to generate proxy SSTs.  A preliminary version of this file is produced in near-real time (1-day latency), and then replaced with a final version after 2 weeks. Note that this is the AVHRR-ONLY (AVHRR-OI), available from September 1, 1981, but there is a companion SST product that includes microwave satellite data, available from June 2002.","Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"NCEI-L4LRblend-GLOB-AVHRR_OI","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-Reference":"Reynolds, R.
