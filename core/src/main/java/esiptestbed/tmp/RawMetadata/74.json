This dataset provides nominal 4.45 km (pixel resolution at reference latitude 70 N) gridded fields that classify First-Year (FY) and Multi-Year (MY) sea ice  using SeaWinds on QuikSCAT scatterometer observations on a daily basis from 20 June 2002 through 23 November 2009. It is unique from other sea ice classification datasets primarily due to its utilization of passive microwave AMSR-E data to provide the initial ocean/ice masking edge and the use of a seasonal threshold for FY and MY sea ice classification from only SeaWinds data.The dataset is derived from daily gridded QuikSCAT vertically polarized (V-pol) egg backscatter data from the SCP, which is made available at the PO.DAAC: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/QUIKSCAT_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ENHANCED . A seasonally varying threshold was derived by Swan and Long (2012) and used to discriminate between FY and MY sea ice based on QuikSCAT V-pol egg backscatter. The sea ice mask was derived by applying threshold constraints to the SCP AMSR-E 6 GHz images, which are made available by the BYU SCP: http://www.scp.byu.edu/data/AMSRE/SIR/AMSRE_sir.html . The data is provided in a CF-compliant, netCDF version 3 format. Further details on the algorithms and validation are described in further detail by Swan and Long (2012). The dataset, software readers and user guide documentation may all be accessed here: ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/quikscat/preview/L3/byu_scp/sea_ice_age/arctic/ .

The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage. The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.  The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans."],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName":["SEAWINDS"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName-Full":["SEAWINDS"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-SwathWidth":["1800"],"DatasetVersion-VersionId":["1"],"DatasetVersion-VersionDateLong":["1351217253984"],"DatasetVersion-Description":["Creation of Dataset via Metadata Tool."],"DatasetVersion-Version":["1"],"_version_":1537168237536477184}
