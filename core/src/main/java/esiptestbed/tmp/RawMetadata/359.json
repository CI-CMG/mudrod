An estimate of the degree 1 gravity coefficients were determined based on ocean and atmospheric models and GRACE coefficients for degrees 2 and higher (Swenson et al. 2008).  The coefficients in this dataset represent the land component of the degree 1 gravity coefficients, normalized using the GRACE standards.  For land applications use, apply these coefficients with the GRACE GSM coefficients for degrees 2 and higher and with a degree 1 Love number (k1) = 0.021.\r\nFor ocean applications, add the degree 1 values found in the ocean bottom pressure dataset (GAD) to the degree 1 coefficients.  If you are interested in adding the full ocean, land and atmosphere coefficients, add the degree 1 values of the atmosphere/ocean dataset (GAC) to these values. Data format is smiler to that for GSM, GAD and GAC files distributed by PO.DAAC, where the fist column is the month in yearmonth.
