The Multiscale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) L4 analysis is based upon nighttime GHRSST L2P skin and subskin SST observations from several instruments such as: the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua and Terra platforms. The ice concentration data are from the archives at the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) High Latitude Processing Center.\r\nThis data set is funded by the NASA MEaSUREs program (http://earthdata.nasa.gov/our-community/community-data-system-programs/measures-projects), and created by a team led by Dr. Toshio Chin from
