All biases and cross-calibrations have been applied to the data so SSHA are consistent between satellites to form a single climate data record.  Altimeter data from the multi-mission Geophysical Data Records (GDRs) are interpolated to a common reference orbit facilitating direct time series analysis of the geo-referenced SSH.  The data are in netCDF format. Each file consists of one cycle of data, which is approximately 10 days long.  Cycle 001 coincides with cycle 001 of TOPEX/Poseidon (September 25-October 3, 1992).","Dataset-SatelliteSpatialResolution":8.0,"Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"Integrated Multi-Mission Ocean Altimeter Data for Climate Research","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-AcrossTrackResolution-Double":5.1,"Dataset-Reference":"Beckley, B.D., N.P.
