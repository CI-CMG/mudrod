This product uses optimal interpolation (OI) from both microwave (MW) sensors including the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE), and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard the GCOM-W1 satellite, and WindSat operates on the Coriolis satellite, and infrared (IR) sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua and Terra platform.  The through-cloud capabilities of microwave radiometers provide a valuable picture of global sea surface temperature (SST) while infrared radiometers (i.e., MODIS) have a higher spatial resolution. This analysis does not use any in situ SST data such as drifting buoy SST.","Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"REMSS-L4HRfnd-GLOB-MWIROI","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-Reference":"http://www.remss.com/measurements/sea-surface-temperature/oisst-description","Dataset-OriginalProvider":"Remote Sensing Systems","Dataset-ProjectionType":"Cylindrical Lat-Lon","Dataset-LongitudeResolution":"0.09","Dataset-SwathWidth":"","Dataset-Doi":"10.5067/GHMWI-4FR04","Dataset-ImageUrl":"http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/Podaac/thumbnails/MW_IR_OI-REMSS-L4-GLOB-v4.0.jpg","Dataset-TemporalResolution-Group":"Daily","Dataset-PersistentId":"PODAAC-GHMWI-4FR04","Dataset-TemporalRepeatMin":"","Dataset-ProcessingLevel":"4","Dataset-ProcessingLevel-Full":"4","Dataset-HorizontalResolutionRange":"9 km","Dataset-AlongTrackResolution":"","Dataset-LatitudeResolution":"0.09","Dataset-Id":"2056","Dataset-TemporalResolutionRange":"none","Dataset-UserPopularity":1012,"Dataset-TemporalResolution":"1 Day","Dataset-TemporalResolution-Full":"1 Day","Dataset-AllTimePopularity":288,"Dataset-TemporalRepeatMax":"","DatasetRegion-RegionDetail":["none"],"DatasetRegion-Region":["Global"],"DatasetRegion-Region-Full":["Global"],"Dataset-Provider-LongName":"Remote Sensing Systems","Dataset-Provider-Type":"DATA-PROVIDER","Dataset-Provider-ShortName":"REMSS","Dataset-Provider-ProviderResource-Path":["http://www.remss.com"],"Dataset-DatasetCoverage-StopTimeLong":"","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-StartTimeLong":"1022889600000","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-TimeSpan":5128,"DatasetCitation-Publisher":["Remote Sensing Systems"],"DatasetCitation-SeriesName":["MWIR"],"DatasetCitation-OnlineResource":["http://www.remss.com"],"DatasetCitation-Creator":["Remote Sensing Systems"],"DatasetCitation-Version":["4.0"],"DatasetCitation-Title":["MWIR optimum interpolated SST data set"],"DatasetCitation-ReleaseDateLong":["1440979200000"],"DatasetCitation-ReleasePlace":["Santa Rosa, CA, USA"],"DatasetCitation-CitationDetail":["AMSR-E data are sponsored by the NASA Earth Science REASoN DISCOVER Project and the AMSR-E Science Team.
