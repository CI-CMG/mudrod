The K10 L4 sea surface temperature analysis uses SST observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager. The age, reliability, and resolution of the data are used in the weighted average with the analysis tuned to represent SST at 1 meter depth. AVHRR Pathfinder 9km climatology is used when no new satellite SST retrievals are available after 34 days.","Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"K10 SST","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-Reference":"","Dataset-OriginalProvider":"Naval Oceanographic Office","Dataset-ProjectionType":"Equidistant cylindrical lat-lon","Dataset-LongitudeResolution":"0.1","Dataset-SwathWidth":"","Dataset-Doi":"10.5067/GHK10-41N01","Dataset-ImageUrl":"http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/Podaac/thumbnails/NAVO-L4HR1m-GLOB-K10_SST.jpg","Dataset-TemporalResolution-Group":"Daily","Dataset-PersistentId":"PODAAC-GHK10-41N01","Dataset-TemporalRepeatMin":"","Dataset-ProcessingLevel":"4","Dataset-ProcessingLevel-Full":"4","Dataset-HorizontalResolutionRange":"none","Dataset-AlongTrackResolution":"","Dataset-LatitudeResolution":"0.1","Dataset-Id":"31","Dataset-TemporalResolutionRange":"none","Dataset-UserPopularity":5,"Dataset-TemporalResolution":"1 Day","Dataset-TemporalResolution-Full":"1 Day","Dataset-AllTimePopularity":179,"Dataset-TemporalRepeatMax":"","DatasetRegion-RegionDetail":["none"],"DatasetRegion-Region":["Global"],"DatasetRegion-Region-Full":["Global"],"Dataset-Provider-LongName":"Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO)","Dataset-Provider-Type":"DATA-PROVIDER","Dataset-Provider-ShortName":"NAVO","Dataset-Provider-ProviderResource-Path":["https://www.navo.navy.mil"],"Dataset-DatasetCoverage-StopTimeLong":"","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-StartTimeLong":"1207008000000","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-TimeSpan":2997,"DatasetCitation-Publisher":["Naval Oceanographic Office"],"DatasetCitation-SeriesName":["K10 Global SST"],"DatasetCitation-OnlineResource":["none"],"DatasetCitation-Creator":["Naval Oceanographic Office"],"DatasetCitation-Version":["1.0"],"DatasetCitation-Title":["K10 Global 10km Analyzed SST data set"],"DatasetCitation-ReleaseDateLong":["1205193600000"],"DatasetCitation-ReleasePlace":["Naval Oceanographic Office, Stennis Space Center, MS, USA"],"DatasetCitation-CitationDetail":["Product created by the Naval Oceanographic Office, 228-688-5176"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Role":["Primary Contact"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Phone":["228-688-4859"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Address":["1002 Balch Blvd, Code NP32, Stennis Space Center, MS 39522, USA"],"DatasetContact-Contact-NotifyType":["none"],"DatasetContact-Contact-MiddleName":["none"],"DatasetContact-Contact-LastName":["May"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Email":["doug.may@navy.mil"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Fax":["228-688-5577"],"DatasetContact-Contact-FirstName":["Doug"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Provider-LongName":["Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO)"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Provider-Type":["DATA-PROVIDER"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Provider-ShortName":["NAVO"],"CollectionDataset-GranuleRange360":"N","DatasetCoverage-StartTimeLong-Long":1207008000000,"DatasetCoverage-MaxDepth":"","DatasetCoverage-StopTimeLong":"","DatasetCoverage-NorthLat":"90","DatasetCoverage-MaxAltitude":"","DatasetCoverage-StopTimeLong-Long":9223372036854775807,"DatasetCoverage-SouthLat":"-90","DatasetCoverage-StartTimeLong":"1207008000000","DatasetCoverage-WestLon":"-180","DatasetCoverage-MinDepth":"","DatasetCoverage-MinAltitude":"","DatasetCoverage-EastLon":"180","DatasetLocationPolicy-BasePath":["http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/nph-dods/ghrsst/L4/GLOB/NAVO/K10_SST","file:///store/ghrsst/open/data/L4/GLOB/NAVO/K10_SST","ftp://podaac-ftp.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/ghrsst/data/L4/GLOB/NAVO/K10_SST","http://podaac-opendap.jpl.nasa.gov/opendap/allData/ghrsst/data/L4/GLOB/NAVO/K10_SST/","ftp://ftp.nodc.noaa.gov/pub/data.nodc/ghrsst/L4/GLOB/NAVO/K10_SST"],"DatasetLocationPolicy-Type":["REMOTE-OPENDAP","ARCHIVE-OPEN","LOCAL-FTP","LOCAL-OPENDAP","REMOTE-FTP"],"DatasetMetaHistory-VersionId":"1","DatasetMetaHistory-RevisionHistory":"2008-03-17 K.
