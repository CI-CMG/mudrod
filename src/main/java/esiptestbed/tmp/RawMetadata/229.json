The Geo-Polar Blended Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Analysis combines multi-satellite retrievals of sea surface temperature into a single analysis of SST. This analysis includes only nighttime data from sensors that include the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imager, the Japanese Advanced Meteorological Imager (JAMI) and in situ data from ships, drifting and moored buoys. This analysis was specifically produced to be used as a lower boundary condition in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. This dataset adheres to the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 2 format specifications.","Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"Geo_Polar_Blended_Night","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-Reference":"","Dataset-OriginalProvider":"OSPO","Dataset-ProjectionType":"Cylindrical Lat-Lon","Dataset-LongitudeResolution":"0.05","Dataset-SwathWidth":"","Dataset-Doi":"10.5067/GHGPN-4FO02","Dataset-ImageUrl":"http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/Podaac/thumbnails/Geo_Polar_Blended_Night-OSPO-L4-GLOB-v1.0.jpg","Dataset-TemporalResolution-Group":"Daily","Dataset-PersistentId":"PODAAC-GHGPN-4FO02","Dataset-TemporalRepeatMin":"","Dataset-ProcessingLevel":"4","Dataset-ProcessingLevel-Full":"4","Dataset-HorizontalResolutionRange":"","Dataset-AlongTrackResolution":"","Dataset-LatitudeResolution":"0.05","Dataset-Id":"1650","Dataset-TemporalResolutionRange":"none","Dataset-UserPopularity":720,"Dataset-TemporalResolution":"1 Day","Dataset-TemporalResolution-Full":"1 Day","Dataset-AllTimePopularity":522,"Dataset-TemporalRepeatMax":"","DatasetRegion-RegionDetail":["none"],"DatasetRegion-Region":["Global"],"DatasetRegion-Region-Full":["Global"],"Dataset-Provider-LongName":"NOAA Office of Satellite and Product Operations","Dataset-Provider-Type":"DATA-PROVIDER","Dataset-Provider-ShortName":"OSPO","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-StopTimeLong":"","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-StartTimeLong":"1401667200000","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-TimeSpan":744,"DatasetCharacter-Value":["character","temporalResolution","51","ellipsoidType","temporalResolutionRange","regionDetail","projectionDetail","latitude resolution","reference","projectionType","null"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Scope":["BOTH","BOTH","BOTH","BOTH","BOTH","BOTH","BOTH","BOTH","BOTH","BOTH","BOTH"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-ObligationFlag":["M","M","M","M","M","M","M","M","M","M","M"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-LongName":["Region","temporal resolution","longitude resolution","ellipsoid type","temporal resolution range","region detail","projection detail","latitude resolution","reference","projection type","horizontal resolution range"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Description":["Geographic area descriptor.","The frequency that the data is sampled.","The resolution for the East and West longitude values in km.","The type of ellipsoid.","The range of frequencies within which the data is sampled.","More specific names not specified in the GCMD valids list.","Free text description of details such as the projections standard parallels, etc., if necessary to fully specify the projection.","The resolution for the North and South latitude values in km.","Key bibilographic references pertaining to the dataset.","The type of projection.","The range of resolutions for the latitude/longitude values."],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Scope":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Type":["character","character","character","character","character","character","character","character","character","character","character"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-ShortName":["region","temporalResolution","longitudeResolution","ellipsoidType","temporalResolutionRange","regionDetail","projectionDetail","latitudeResolution","reference","projectionType","horizontalResolutionRage"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-MaxLength":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"DatasetCitation-Publisher":["The GHRSST Project Office"],"DatasetCitation-SeriesName":["OSPO L4 0.05 degree"],"DatasetCitation-OnlineResource":["www.osdpd.nesdis.noaa.gov"],"DatasetCitation-Creator":["Office of Satellite Products and Operations"],"DatasetCitation-Version":["1.0"],"DatasetCitation-Title":["OSPO L4 SST Analysis (GDS2)"],"DatasetCitation-ReleaseDateLong":["1426032000000"],"DatasetCitation-ReleasePlace":["Office of Satellite Products and Operations"],"DatasetCitation-CitationDetail":["Fieguth,P.W. et al.
