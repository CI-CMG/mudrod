The SeaWinds scatterometer scans at two nominal incidence angles, 46 degrees and 54.1 degrees, corresponding to the inner and outer beams respectively. The inner beam is horizontally polarized while the outer beam is vertically polarized. The SIR files are all contained within a single tar file for a given day. When the tar file is unpacked, the individual SIR files are separated according to polarization and the corresponding retrieval statistic (i.e., daily average, standard deviation, and daily measurement counts). Consequently, there are 6 SIR files contained within each unpacked tar file. These SIR files were also used to generate a complimentary dataset of GIF images representing the daily averaged Sigma-0, which is meant for browse purposes only and available here: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SEAWINDS_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ARCTIC_POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC_BROWSE_IMAGES. An additional complimentary dataset includes a reduced version of these Sigma-0 retrieval statistics by providing only the daily Sigma-0 average: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SEAWINDS_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ARCTIC_POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC_BROWSE_MAPS_LITE.

The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage. The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.  The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans."],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName":["SEAWINDS"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName-Full":["SEAWINDS"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-SwathWidth":["1800"],"DatasetVersion-VersionId":["1"],"DatasetVersion-VersionDateLong":["1284585792413"],"DatasetVersion-Description":["Initial creation of dataset."],"DatasetVersion-Version":["1"],"Collection-LongName":["SeaWinds on ADEOS-II Level 3 Sigma-0 Daily Browse Datasets"],"Collection-LongName-Full":["SeaWinds on ADEOS-II Level 3 Sigma-0 Daily Browse Datasets"],"Collection-CollectionId":["528"],"Collection-ShortName":["SEAWINDS_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_DAILY_BROWSE"],"Collection-ShortName-Full":["SEAWINDS_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_DAILY_BROWSE"],"_version_":1537168197329879040,"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-MaxLength":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-ObligationFlag":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Scope":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-LongName":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Type":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Scope":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-Value":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-ShortName":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Description":["NULL"]}
