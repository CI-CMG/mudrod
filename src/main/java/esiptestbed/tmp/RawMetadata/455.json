The instruments on OSTM make direct observations of the following quantities: altimeter range, significant wave height, ocean radar backscatter cross-section (a measure of wind speed), ionospheric electron content (derived by a simple formula), tropospheric water content, mean sea surface, Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA), and position relative to the GPS satellite constellation.  This dataset does contains less parameters than those found in the regular IGDR.  The parameters in this dataset relate directly to the calculation of SSHA.  These data are distributed by NOAA NODC (National Ocean Data Center).","Dataset-SatelliteSpatialResolution":8.0,"Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"OSTM/Jason-2 Interim Geophysical Data Record Sea Surface
