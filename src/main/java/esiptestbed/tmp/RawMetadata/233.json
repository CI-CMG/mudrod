Data is provided daily and partitioned according to ascending and descending passes; where multiple passes occur over a given point, data from the most recent pass over-writes the earlier (adjacent) pass. Wind vectors are accurate to within 2 m/s (vector speed) and 20 degrees (vector direction). Rain flags are provided for each wind vector cell to assist in identifying potential rain contamination. This product utilizes JPL's most up-to-date calibration, validation, and science data processing from the QSCAT-1/F13 geophysical model function, adopted in July of 2006.","Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"SeaWinds on ADEOS-II L3 Ocean Wind Vectors w/AMSR corrections (JPL)","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-Reference":"Lungu, T., July 2006.

The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage. The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.  The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans.","The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) is an eight-frequency, total-power passive microwave radiometer with dual polarization (except two vertical channels in the 50GHz band)."],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName":["SEAWINDS","AMSR"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName-Full":["SEAWINDS","AMSR"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-SwathWidth":["1800","1600"],"_version_":1537168174830583808,"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-MaxLength":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-ObligationFlag":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Scope":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-LongName":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Type":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Scope":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-Value":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-ShortName":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Description":["NULL"]}
