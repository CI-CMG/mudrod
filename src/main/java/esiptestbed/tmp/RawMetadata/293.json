They are simply the daily SSTs from the Reynolds National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) 0.25 degree GHRSST dataset, gridded and averaged using the Aquarius processing L2-L3 processing scheme to the same 1 degree spatial resolution and daily, 7 day, monthly, Daily, and Daily time intervals as Aquarius L3 standard salinity and wind speed products.  This particular data set is the Daily ancillary sea surface temperature product associated with version 4.0 of the Aquarius data set, which is the official end of prime mission public data release from the AQUARIUS/SAC-D mission.","Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-Reference":"Reynolds, R.W, T.M.Smith, C.Liu, D.B.
