This product uses optimal interpolation (OI) using data from the 4 km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder Version 5 time series (when available, otherwise operational NOAA AVHRR data are used) and in situ ship and buoy observations. A second similar product is available that also includes Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) data from June 2002 onward. The OI analysis is a daily average SST that is bias adjusted using a spatially smoothed 7-day in situ SST average and is thus tuned to about 0.3 meter. Both day and night satellite fields are independently bias adjusted.
