These observations can detect regional mass changes of Earth's water reservoirs over land, ice and oceans. GRACE measures gravity variations by relating it to the distance variations between the two satellites, which fly in the same orbit, separated by about 240 km at an altitude of ~450 km. The monthly ocean mass grids contain ocean bottom pressure anomalies from GRACE time-variable gravity data relative to a time-mean. The bottom pressure anomalies are given in 'equivalent water thickness'  (in ASCII format), so can be compared to sea level anomalies due to changes of water mass (reference density is 1027 kg/m^3).  The time coverage for the monthly grids are determined by GRACE months.  For the list of GRACE month dates visit \r\nhttp://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/grace-months/.
