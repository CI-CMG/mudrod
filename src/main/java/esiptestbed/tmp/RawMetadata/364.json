It provides a daily cloud-free field of foundation sea surface temperature at approximately 2 km resolution (0.02 degree) for the Mediterranean Sea. It is generated by merging microwave and infrared satellite sea surface temperature observations including those from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE), and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI). The satellite SST observations are  intercalibrated using the AATSR sensor as a reference (previously re-calibrated using all available in situ data).  This dataset was the first Level 4 product produced by the GHRSST Project. It has been superseded by the ODYSSEA L4 product for this region: GHRSST Level 4 ODYSSEA Mediterranean Sea Regional Foundation Sea Surface Temperature Analysis.","Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-v01","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-Reference":"Medspiration products user manual, Robinson I., Leborgne P., Piolle J.F., Larnicol G., v1.02, September 2004","Dataset-OriginalProvider":"IFREMER","Dataset-ProjectionType":"Cylindrical Lat-Lon","Dataset-LongitudeResolution":"0.02","Dataset-SwathWidth":"","Dataset-Doi":"10.5067/GHMED-4FE01","Dataset-ImageUrl":"http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/Podaac/thumbnails/EUR-L4UHFnd-MED-v01.jpg","Dataset-TemporalResolution-Group":"Daily","Dataset-PersistentId":"PODAAC-GHMED-4FE01","Dataset-TemporalRepeatMin":"","Dataset-ProcessingLevel":"4","Dataset-ProcessingLevel-Full":"4","Dataset-HorizontalResolutionRange":"none","Dataset-AlongTrackResolution":"","Dataset-LatitudeResolution":"0.02","Dataset-Id":"22","Dataset-TemporalResolutionRange":"none","Dataset-UserPopularity":174,"Dataset-TemporalResolution":"1 Day","Dataset-TemporalResolution-Full":"1 Day","Dataset-AllTimePopularity":934,"Dataset-TemporalRepeatMax":"","DatasetRegion-RegionDetail":["Mediterranean and Black Seas"],"DatasetRegion-Region":["Mediterranean Sea"],"DatasetRegion-Region-Full":["Mediterranean Sea"],"Dataset-Provider-LongName":"Institut Francais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer, Center d'Exploitation et de Recherche Satellitaire","Dataset-Provider-Type":"DATA-PROVIDER","Dataset-Provider-ShortName":"IFREMER/CERSAT","Dataset-Provider-ProviderResource-Path":["http://www.ifremer.fr/anglais/","http://cersat.ifremer.fr","http://www.ifremer.fr/cersat/en/index.html"],"Dataset-DatasetCoverage-StopTimeLong":"1200268800000","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-StartTimeLong":"1107043200000","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-TimeSpan":1079,"DatasetCitation-Publisher":["Medspiration, IFREMER/CERSAT"],"DatasetCitation-SeriesName":["Medspiration L4 Ultra-high Resolution SSTfnd (L4UHRfnd)"],"DatasetCitation-OnlineResource":["ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr"],"DatasetCitation-Creator":["ESA Medspiration: Meteo France/Meteo France, Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS), Lannion, 22303 Lannion, cedex, France;
