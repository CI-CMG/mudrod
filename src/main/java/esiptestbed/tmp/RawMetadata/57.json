Generally there are several GOES satellites in geosynchronous orbit at any one time viewing different earth locations including the GOES-11 launched 3 May 2000. The radiometer aboard the satellite, The GOES I-M Imager, is a five channel (one visible, four infrared) imaging radiometer designed to sense radiant and solar reflected energy from sampled areas of the earth. The multi-element spectral channels simultaneously sweep east-west and west-east along a north-to-south path by means of a two-axis mirror scan system retuning telemetry in 10-bit precision.  For this Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) dataset,  skin sea surface temperature (SST) measurements  are calculated from the far IR channels of GOES-11 at full resolution on a half hourly basis. In native satellite projection, vertically adjacent pixels are averaged and read out at every pixel. L2P datasets including  Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES) are then derived following the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5.  The full disk image is subsetted into granules representing  distinct northern and southern regions.","Dataset-SatelliteSpatialResolution":4.0,"Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"GOES11","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-AcrossTrackResolution-Double":4.2,"Dataset-Reference":"GOES-SST Programmers Reference Manual","Dataset-OriginalProvider":"NOAA/NESDIS","Dataset-ProjectionType":"Satellite native view / two vertical cells blended","Dataset-LongitudeResolution":"","Dataset-SwathWidth":"","Dataset-Doi":"10.5067/GHG11-2PO01","Dataset-ImageUrl":"http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/Podaac/thumbnails/OSDPD-L2P-GOES11.jpg","Dataset-PersistentId":"PODAAC-GHG11-2PO01","Dataset-TemporalRepeatMin":"0.5 Hour","Dataset-ProcessingLevel":"2P","Dataset-ProcessingLevel-Full":"2P","Dataset-HorizontalResolutionRange":"none","Dataset-AlongTrackResolution":"4600","Dataset-LatitudeResolution":"","Dataset-Id":"24","Dataset-TemporalResolutionRange":"","Dataset-UserPopularity":122,"Dataset-TemporalResolution":"","Dataset-TemporalResolution-Full":"","Dataset-AllTimePopularity":82,"Dataset-TemporalRepeatMax":"0.5 Hour","DatasetRegion-RegionDetail":["Central/Eastern Pacific"],"DatasetRegion-Region":["Pacific Ocean"],"DatasetRegion-Region-Full":["Pacific Ocean"],"Dataset-Provider-LongName":"NOAA Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution","Dataset-Provider-Type":"DATA-PROVIDER","Dataset-Provider-ShortName":"OSDPD","Dataset-Provider-ProviderResource-Path":["http://www.osdpd.noaa.gov"],"Dataset-DatasetCoverage-StopTimeLong":"1310309727000","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-StartTimeLong":"1166747400000","Dataset-DatasetCoverage-TimeSpan":1661,"DatasetCitation-Publisher":["NOAA/NESDIS"],"DatasetCitation-SeriesName":["Sea Surface Temperature produced by NOAA/NESDIS"],"DatasetCitation-OnlineResource":[""],"DatasetCitation-Creator":["NOAA/NESDIS USA, 5200 Auth Rd, Camp Springs, MD, 20746"],"DatasetCitation-Version":["4.0"],"DatasetCitation-Title":["Sea Surface Temperature, 180W-110W and 60N-45S, at 0.05 degree resolution from GOES-11 Imager every 0.5 hours"],"DatasetCitation-ReleaseDateLong":["1164585600000"],"DatasetCitation-ReleasePlace":["Camp Springs, MD (USA)"],"DatasetCitation-CitationDetail":["These data are produced by NOAA/NESDIS funded by NESDIS Office of System Development"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Role":["Technical Contact","Technical Contact"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Phone":["301-763-8384","301-763-8102 x172"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Address":["5200 Auth Road, Camp Springs, MD 20746, U.S.A.","NOAA/NESDIS/STAR/SOCD, 5200 Auth Road, WWB, RM 601 Camp Springs, MD 20746, USA"],"DatasetContact-Contact-NotifyType":["none","none"],"DatasetContact-Contact-MiddleName":["","none"],"DatasetContact-Contact-LastName":["Potash","Maturi"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Email":["bob.potash@noaa.gov","Eileen.Maturi@noaa.gov"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Fax":["none","301-763-8572"],"DatasetContact-Contact-FirstName":["Robert","Eileen"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Provider-LongName":["NOAA Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution","NOAA Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Provider-Type":["DATA-PROVIDER","DATA-PROVIDER"],"DatasetContact-Contact-Provider-ShortName":["OSDPD","OSDPD"],"CollectionDataset-GranuleRange360":"N","DatasetCoverage-StartTimeLong-Long":1166747400000,"DatasetCoverage-MaxDepth":"0","DatasetCoverage-StopTimeLong":"1310309727000","DatasetCoverage-NorthLat":"60","DatasetCoverage-MaxAltitude":"0","DatasetCoverage-StopTimeLong-Long":1310309727000,"DatasetCoverage-SouthLat":"-45","DatasetCoverage-StartTimeLong":"1166747400000","DatasetCoverage-WestLon":"-180","DatasetCoverage-MinDepth":"0","DatasetCoverage-MinAltitude":"0","DatasetCoverage-EastLon":"-110","DatasetLocationPolicy-BasePath":["file:///store/ghrsst/open/data/L2P/GOES11/OSDPD","ftp://ftp.nodc.noaa.gov/pub/data.nodc/ghrsst/L2P/GOES11/OSDPD","ftp://podaac-ftp.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/ghrsst/data/L2P/GOES11/OSDPD","http://podaac-opendap.jpl.nasa.gov/opendap/allData/ghrsst/data/L2P/GOES11/OSDPD/","http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/nph-dods/ghrsst/L2P/GOES11/OSDPD"],"DatasetLocationPolicy-Type":["ARCHIVE-OPEN","REMOTE-FTP","LOCAL-FTP","LOCAL-OPENDAP","REMOTE-OPENDAP"],"DatasetMetaHistory-VersionId":"1","DatasetMetaHistory-RevisionHistory":"2006-10-28.
