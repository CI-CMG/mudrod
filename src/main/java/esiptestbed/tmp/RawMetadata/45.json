The instruments on Jason-1 make direct observations of the following quantities: altimeter range, significant wave height, ocean radar backscatter cross-section (a measure of wind speed), ionospheric electron content (derived by a simple formula), tropospheric water content, mean sea surface, and position relative to the GPS satellite constellation. The GDR contain all relevant corrections needed to calculate the Sea Surface Height (SSH) and Anomalies (SSHA). SSH and SSHA calculations and recommended data editing criteria are specified in the Jason-1 I/GDR User Handbook located at ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/jason1/L2/gdr_c/docs/Handbook_Jason_v4-1.pdf.  Version C contain new parameters pseudo datation bias, high frequency fluctuations and mean dynamic topography.  The binary GDR is the official and vetted dataset from the Jason-1 project.  It is available as 10 day cycles, each containing 254 passes.  It is also the most accurate dataset produced by the Jason-1 project.","Dataset-SatelliteSpatialResolution":8.0,"Dataset-ProviderDatasetName":"Jason-1 GDR-C","Dataset-Note":"","Dataset-AcrossTrackResolution-Double":5.1,"Dataset-Reference":"Picot, N, K Case, S Desai and P Vincent 2008.

The measurements made at the two frequencies are combined to obtain measurements of the altimeter range, wind speed, significant wave height, and the ionospheric correction. The Poseidon-2 package consists of dual redundant altimeter units each of which has low mass and low power consumption.","The JMR mreasures teh sea surface microwave brightness temperatures at three frequencies (18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz and 34.0 GHz) to provide the total water vapor content in the troposphere along the altimeter beam. The 23.8 GHz channel is the primary channel for water-vapor measurement and is a redundant channel on the JMR. The 18.7 GHz channel provides a correction for wind-induced effects in the sea surface background emissions, and the 34.0 GHz channel provides a correction for cloud liquid water. The measurements are combined to obtain the error in the satellite range measurements caused by pulse delay due to the water vapor.","The TRSR isa an advanced codeless sixteen-channel Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver developed bye the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The on-board package is comprised of dual redunedant TRSR units and choke ring antennae. The GPS data are intended to provide supplementary positioning data in support of the POD function and/or to improve gravity field models.","The LRA reflects signals from network of 10 to 15 satellite laser tracking stations to calibrate NRA bias and to provide the baseline tracking data for NASA precise orbit determination.","The DORIS system uses a two-channels receiver (1401.25 MHz and 2036.25 MHz) on the satellite to observe the Doppler signals from a network of 40 to 50 ground transmitting stations. It provides all-weather global tracking of the satellite for CNES precise orbit determination and an accurate correction for the influence of the ionosphere on both the Doppler signal and altimeter signals."],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName":["POSEIDON-2","JMR","TRSR","LRA","DORIS"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-ShortName-Full":["POSEIDON-2","JMR","TRSR","LRA","DORIS"],"DatasetSource-Sensor-SwathWidth":["","","","","0"],"DatasetVersion-VersionId":["1"],"DatasetVersion-VersionDateLong":[""],"DatasetVersion-Description":[""],"DatasetVersion-Version":["N/A"],"_version_":1537168226031501312,"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-MaxLength":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-ObligationFlag":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Scope":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-LongName":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Type":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Scope":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-Value":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-ShortName":["NULL"],"DatasetCharacter-DatasetElement-Element-Description":["NULL"]}
